I’ve been back four times in the past six months –each experience is better than the last and I always look forward to coming back. As impressive as the hotel is, the team of people are what make each stay exceptional. Everyone is so friendly and they go out of their way to ensure that I have a perfect stay every single time. Petar in particular always ensures that my stay is wonderful every time and gives me total peace of mind every time I stay there - I never have to worry about a thing and he goes above and beyond to provide excellent service.\n",

        "\"\"\"There are not enough words to explain the sumptuousness and comfortable elegance you are treated to as a guest at Faena. Their holistic approach to relaxation and community is in paralleled. While every area was wonderful, standouts were Los Fuegos and the Spa. Their staff is magnificent and know how to care for your every whim. Thank you Solange for the welcome and checking!\n",

        "\"\"\"I went for the Burlesque show which was absolutely amazing. The service was top tier. My bartender was Patty, my drinks were great, one of the best whiskey sours I've had. My server Tatiana was awesome, so sweet and attentive. I highly recommend the show if you get a chance and ask for Patty at the bar\"\"\",\n",
        "\"\"\"Dana at Gitano made the night magical! He makes me want to fly to Miami from Chicago for dinner so he can be my server! The hotel is smart to have Dana as a brand ambassador! Well done Faena Hotel for this!\"\"\",\n",
        "\"\"\"I would like to give our very very heartfelt thanks to Mr. Raúl Díaz, the Reservations Supervisor ! He was just so helpful and kind ! He just did an amazing Service ! So when ever you planning to go to Miami you have to stay at the Faena Miami and have to get in contact with Mr. Díaz !\"\"\",\n",
        "\"\"\"I have to create time to come write this review. First, I have to say how amazing Sophia in the reservations department was. She was very patient with me and my guests in helping me book the correct room for their stay. the Emerson Family loves her and speaks really highly of her. the Faena Hotel will always be my #1 recommendation hotel for Miami. everyone was very helpful and professional.\n",
        "Stephanie-travel Luxury\"\"\",\n",
        "\"\"\"Faena is over-rated.\n",
        "\n",
        "It would be a 3 star review if it were a 4 star $500 a night type place. But given the price point (we paid $1600/night for our room) and 5 star rating, I am giving it 2. There are much better options for the price point and 5 star category in this location, in my experience (have stayed in miami beach multiple times).\n",
        "\n",
        "To start with the positive: The services is really good/attentive, the grounds (not rooms) and restaurants are cool/flashy/sceney, and the pool/grounds are solid (not the best in miami). It is popular for the restaurants and cool designs on the grounds and well trained staff. However overall I think there are much better luxury options in miami beach / south beach for an actual stay, if you care more about quality of rooms/actual property, location, and pool.\n",
        "\n",
        "Issues: 1) the rooms are not that nice. We booked a junior king suite partial ocean view room for $1600/night. The room felt like 4 star vegas with no view. Low ceilings, bones and finishing quality mediocre, cool design touches but overall not 5 star room bones. 2) the hotel is right next to another taller / bigger building that is pretty close, so 95% of the view was blocked/looking directly at that building. We were on the north side which is where half the rooms of the type we booked are, maybe the other side is better. We didnt feel like we were on the beach despite the price and description of the room, you could not see ocean unless standing at an extreme angle to the window. We asked for an upgrade because we thought the description was misleading; we were told this was normal / how the rooms were, and would have to pay significantly more to upgrade. 3) location: it isnt that close to nice restaurants other than the ones at the hotel, which are good, but there isnt much to do around the actual hotel. Options are stay on the grounds or get a 20 minute uber. Not walkable.\n",

We were on the north side which is where half the rooms of the type we booked are, maybe the other side is better. We didnt feel like we were on the beach despite the price and description of the room, you could not see ocean unless standing at an extreme angle to the window. We asked for an upgrade because we thought the description was misleading; we were told this was normal / how the rooms were, and would have to pay significantly more to upgrade. 3) location: it isnt that close to nice restaurants other than the ones at the hotel, which are good, but there isnt much to do around the actual hotel.

But given the price point (we paid $1600/night for our room) and 5 star rating, I am giving it 2. There are much better options for the price point and 5 star category in this location, in my experience (have stayed in miami beach multiple times).\\n\\nTo start with the positive: The services is really good/attentive, the grounds (not rooms) and restaurants are cool/flashy/sceney, and the pool/grounds are solid (not the best in miami). It is popular for the restaurants and cool designs on the grounds and well trained staff. However overall I think there are much better luxury options in miami beach / south beach for an actual stay, if you care more about quality of rooms/actual property, location, and pool.\\n\\nIssues: 1) the rooms are not that nice. We booked a junior king suite partial ocean view room for $1600/night. The room felt like 4 star vegas with no view. Low ceilings, bones and finishing quality mediocre, cool design touches but overall not 5 star room bones. 2) the hotel is right next to another taller / bigger building that is pretty close, so 95% of the view was blocked/looking directly at that building. We were on the north side which is where half the rooms of the type we booked are, maybe the other side is better. We didnt feel like we were on the beach despite the price and description of the room, you could not see ocean unless standing at an extreme angle to the window. We asked for an upgrade because we thought the description was misleading; we were told this was normal / how the rooms were, and would have to pay significantly more to upgrade. 3) location: it isnt that close to nice restaurants other than the ones at the hotel, which are good, but there isnt much to do around the actual hotel. Options are stay on the grounds or get a 20 minute uber. Not walkable.\\n\\nOverall I would go here for dinner / drinks and stay somewhere else. One hotel (better all around, most similar from a luxury standpoint but better luxury IMO), Standard (better vibe, better pool, not as luxury, but cooler, and better location), and fountainebleau (better resort-like if that is what you want, faena is kind of resort like) are all better options in my experience. All have better views/pool, and the One and Standard are notably better locations (especially the standard; One is closer / more walkable.

            "Given the following Reviews for a hotels\n",
            "Reviews=Resturant # 1 Hands down my absolute favorite hotel in South Beach—there’s no place I’d rather stay. I’ve been back four times in the past six months –each experience is better than the last and I always look forward to coming back. As impressive as the hotel is, the team of people are what make each stay exceptional. Everyone is so friendly and they go out of their way to ensure that I have a perfect stay every single time. Petar in particular always ensures that my stay is wonderful every time and gives me total peace of mind every time I stay there - I never have to worry about a thing and he goes above and beyond to provide excellent service.\n",
            "\n",
            "I’ve stayed at many hotels in South Beach/Miami and they’re in a league of their own.\t \n",
            " Resturant # 2 There are not enough words to explain the sumptuousness and comfortable elegance you are treated to as a guest at Faena. Their holistic approach to relaxation and community is in paralleled. While every area was wonderful, standouts were Los Fuegos and the Spa. Their staff is magnificent and know how to care for your every whim. Thank you Solange for the welcome and checking!\n",
            "We will be back \n",
            " Resturant # 3 I went for the Burlesque show which was absolutely amazing. The service was top tier. My bartender was Patty, my drinks were great, one of the best whiskey sours I've had. My server Tatiana was awesome, so sweet and attentive. I highly recommend the show if you get a chance and ask for Patty at the bar \n",
            " Resturant # 4 Dana at Gitano made the night magical! He makes me want to fly to Miami from Chicago for dinner so he can be my server! The hotel is smart to have Dana as a brand ambassador! Well done Faena Hotel for this! \n",
            " Resturant # 5 I would like to give our very very heartfelt thanks to Mr. Raúl Díaz, the Reservations Supervisor ! He was just so helpful and kind ! He just did an amazing Service ! So when ever you planning to go to Miami you have to stay at the Faena Miami and have to get in contact with Mr. Díaz ! \n",
            " Resturant # 6 I have to create time to come write this review. First, I have to say how amazing Sophia in the reservations department was. She was very patient with me and my guests in helping me book the correct room for their stay. the Emerson Family loves her and speaks really highly of her. the Faena Hotel will always be my #1 recommendation hotel for Miami. everyone was very helpful and professional.\n",
            "Stephanie-travel Luxury \n",
            " Resturant # 7 Faena is over-rated.\n",
            "\n",
            "It would be a 3 star review if it were a 4 star $500 a night type place. But given the price point (we paid $1600/night for our room) and 5 star rating, I am giving it 2. There are much better options for the price point and 5 star category in this location, in my experience (have stayed in miami beach multiple times).\n",
            "\n",
            "To start with the positive: The services is really good/attentive, the grounds (not rooms) and restaurants are cool/flashy/sceney, and the pool/grounds are solid (not the best in miami). It is popular for the restaurants and cool designs on the grounds and well trained staff. However overall I think there are much better luxury options in miami beach / south beach for an actual stay, if you care more about quality of rooms/actual property, location, and pool.\n",
            "\n",
            "Issues: 1) the rooms are not that nice. We booked a junior king suite partial ocean view room for $1600/night. The room felt like 4 star vegas with no view. Low ceilings, bones and finishing quality mediocre, cool design touches but overall not 5 star room bones. 2) the hotel is right next to another taller / bigger building that is pretty close, so 95% of the view was blocked/looking directly at that building. We were on the north side which is where half the rooms of the type we booked are, maybe the other side is better. We didnt feel like we were on the beach despite the price and description of the room, you could not see ocean unless standing at an extreme angle to the window. We asked for an upgrade because we thought the description was misleading; we were told this was normal / how the rooms were, and would have to pay significantly more to upgrade. 3) location: it isnt that close to nice restaurants other than the ones at the hotel, which are good, but there isnt much to do around the actual hotel. Options are stay on the grounds or get a 20 minute uber. Not walkable.\n",
            "\n",
            "Overall I would go here for dinner / drinks and stay somewhere else. One hotel (better all around, most similar from a luxury standpoint but better luxury IMO), Standard (better vibe, better pool, not as luxury, but cooler, and better location), and fountainebleau (better resort-like if that is what you want, faena is kind of resort like) are all better options in my experience. All have better views/pool, and the One and Standard are notably better locations (especially the standard; One is closer / more walkable. The FB is even further/worse location but if you dont want to leave it is better than Faena). I think Faena gets the strong reviews more from the service (which is great and which does make people want to reciprocate with a good review) and the restaurants (they are cool but you dont need to stay here to eat here). And the unique designs/art. But actual rooms, views, location all mediocre, pool etc. fine but not standout. \n",
            " Resturant # 8 The service at the Faena is exceptional. From check in with Sebastian, to the door men at the Jazz lounge, to the cleaning personnel (room 713, you were amazing!)- these folks were a delight. I am pregnant right now, and found out the gender of my baby while staying at the property- Shout out to Vanina, Rosa R. And Lylda P. For helping me plan the most EPIC gender reveal for my husband in the garden behind the mammoth and for helping us capture the day with photos! You all are rockstars! It really made the trip so special. Cannot thank you enough! \n",
